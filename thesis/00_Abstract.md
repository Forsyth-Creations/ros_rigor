# Specific Abstract

The era of AI demands ever increasing computational power. As we dawn the era of general purpose robotics, this trend repeats. For complex robotics systems, thoughtful choices of both software and hardware architecure are required for optimal performance. This paper explores one such implentation: a swerve drive robot, leveraging an Intel Realsense D435i depth camera, to navigate a room using the slam_toolbox and Nav2 stack.
