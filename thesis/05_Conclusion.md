# Conclusion

This paper examined the computational demands of AI-driven robotics, focusing on the design and implementation of a swerve drive robot. Utilizing an Intel RealSense D435i depth camera, slam_toolbox, and the Nav2 stack, the robot navigated a room within the Gazebo simulation environment, with plans for deployment on a physical platform. The study explored optimal software and hardware architecture choices to enhance performance while addressing compute utilization to prevent system bottlenecks. This was further tested on a Raspberry Pi 5 in preperation for the final deployment to ensure compute utilization did not exceed the boundary. The results demonstrated the feasibility of deploying complex software systems on low-power OS-capable hardware, providing a roadmap for future research and development in the field of general-purpose robotics.
