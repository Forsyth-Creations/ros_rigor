[]: # ## Goal 1: Get the robot to move in a straight line
[]: # 
[]: # ### Notes
[]: # - The robot is a simulated Turtlebot3 Burger. It has a Lidar and a camera. The Lidar is used for navigation, and the camera is used for object detection.
[]: # - The robot is controlled by a ROS2 node that subscribes to the /cmd_vel topic. The node takes in a linear and angular velocity and sends it to the robot.
[]: # - The robot is also equipped with a PID controller that takes in the current position of the robot and the desired position and calculates the necessary linear and angular velocity to reach the desired position.
[]: # 
[]: # ### Conclusion
[]: # - The robot can move in a straight line by sending a linear velocity of 0.1 m/s and an angular velocity of 0 rad/s to the /cmd_vel topic.
