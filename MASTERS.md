# Facts

You can install a kernel with whatever customization you deem fit `RT_PREEMPT`.

# Scoping my thesis: stream of consciousness

Guiding question: how do I make robots last longer?

What limits the lifespan of robots?
- Sensor damage, wear and tear
- Battery lifespan/cycles limited (so don't use as much power)

What about the lifecycle of robotics development? How do we meet the needs of the low-level consumers?

Power consumption of robots, and training their AI models, is a currently active area of research.
